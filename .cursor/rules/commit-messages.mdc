# Commit Message Convention

When generating git commit messages for this repository, always follow this exact structure:

1. **Semantic title line** using Conventional Commits style (no trailing period), e.g.:
   - `feat: add raster vectorizer tool`
   - `fix: correct bundle builder export bug`
   - `chore: update dependencies`
2. **Blank line**
3. **What** section
4. **Blank line**
5. **Why** section
6. **Blank line**
7. **Testing** section

The full commit message format should look like this:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: short, imperative summary

What:
- Bullet points summarizing the concrete code changes.

Why:
- Brief explanation of the motivation, intent, or bug being fixed.

Testing:
- List of tests run (e.g. npm test, npm run lint, manual flows), or "Testing: not tested".
```

## Additional guidelines

- Keep the **title line** under ~72 characters when possible.
- Wrap body lines naturally instead of creating very long lines (assume word wrap is enabled in the editor).
- Use clear, concise language that focuses on **why** the change is needed, not just what changed.
- Prefer present tense and imperative mood in the title (e.g. "add", "fix", "update").
