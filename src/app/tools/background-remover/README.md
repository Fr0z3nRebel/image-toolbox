## Tips for Best Results

### Auto Mode
- Works best with solid or gradient backgrounds
- Adjust tolerance based on background complexity:
  - Lower tolerance (10-30%) for simple, solid backgrounds
  - Higher tolerance (40-80%) for complex or varied backgrounds
- Use edge smoothing for more natural-looking results

### Drawing Mode
- Use smaller brush sizes for detailed work around edges
- Take your time with complex subjects like hair or fur
- Use the eraser tool to correct over-painting
- The red overlay shows what will be removed, blue shows what will be kept
