## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

for more details.

## Running & Adding Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
for unit and integration testing.

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode (re-runs tests on file changes):

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Adding a Test

1. **Create a test file:**
   - Place your test files in a `__tests__` directory within the relevant
     feature/component directory. For example, for app-specific tests, use
     `src/app/__tests__`.
   - Name your test files with the `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extension (e.g.,
     `component.test.tsx`).

2. **Write a test:**
   - Import the component you want to test.
   - Use `@testing-library/react` to render the component and make assertions.

Example:

```tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import MyComponent from "../MyComponent";

describe("MyComponent", () => {
  it("renders the correct text", () => {
    render(<MyComponent />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Hello World")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

3. **Run your tests** to verify they pass.
